RGB
=======
Contains code examples for controlling RGB LEDs

Hardware
---------
* Nano Arduino with ATmega328
* RGB LED with a common anode (common plus)
* Three 220 ohm resistors
* Breadboard and wire

Common anode is connected to the 5V pin. The minus leads are first connected to a resistor and then to digital pins (see code for nrs).

BlinkRGB
---------
Test code which changes the color of the LED.
